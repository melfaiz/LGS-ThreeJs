## ThreeJS
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL. 

## Browser support
Three.js can use WebGL to render your scenes on all modern browsers. For older browsers, especially Internet Explorer 10 and below, you may have to fallback to one of the other renderers (CSS2DRenderer, CSS3DRenderer, SVGRenderer). Additionally, you may have to include some polyfills, especially if you are using files from the /examples folder.

### Note: 
If you don't need to support these old browsers, then it is not recommended to use the other renderers as they are slower and support less features than the WebGLRenderer.
